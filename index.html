                Everyone has to have an animal they value or appreciate over many others, here we hope to collect a lot of people's favorite(s) and why! 
                For me personally I used to be a big fan of pandas when I was a kid, maybe it was because it was how exotic they were and I wanted to be unique, or maybe it was because of how large and cuddly they looked.
                As I grew up it ended up becoming dogs, because I just saw how amazing they were as pets I couldn't help but want one for myself, I eventually got one when I was in 7th grade and loved (and stil love) her to death.
                Though now as of recent I've become a big cat fanatic, I think this is because I've adopted a much more relaxed lifestyle that cats seem to fit much easier.
